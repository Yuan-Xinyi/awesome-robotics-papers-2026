**Basics**
- [Demystifying Action Space Design for Robotic Manipulation Policies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23408)
  > **Quote:** Our large-scale results suggest that properly designing the policy to predict delta actions consistently improves performance, while joint-space and task-space representations offer complementary strengths, favoring control stability and generalization, respectively.

**Action Smoothing**
- [DiffOG: Differentiable Policy Trajectory Optimization With Generalizability](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11267071)
